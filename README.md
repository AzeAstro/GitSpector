# GitSpector
GitSpector(or GitInspector) is a tool for finding emails from a GitHub repository. ***100% success is not guaranteed!!!***
  

## What is this shit?
It is a script that searches emails from commits. It might or not find it. Pure luck.



## How does shit work??
It searches for patches of a repository and then tries to find emails. 

## Alright, what's next?
I dunno. Ligma?


## Let's say I need to use it. Howtf am I gonna use it?
So, uhm... You just run script,enter repository URL and that is it?  
```cmd
python Inspector.py
```
Done?

## How to install this shit?
Requirements:  
1) Python 3
2) BeautifulSoup
3) Requests

Either use 
``` cmd
pip install beautifulsoup4 requests
```

or 
```cmd
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## Any special tips for usage maybe?
Yes but no, I won't say it. Move ur ass or at least move ur fingers to find it on Google. Really, don't be obese coder. Both use ur muscules and brain to achieve something.


## The fuck is `experiments.py` and `drafts.py`?
It is not ur shit. Only for me. Won't find anything special there. 



## Why the fuck it is the worst Readme?
Cuz I can't write a proper one. (And it doesn't feel natural when you write it normal.)
